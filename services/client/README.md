## Project Structure
The majority of code for this project is located in the `src` folder. From there, the `pages` folder contains React components which are responsible for rendering out full pages. The `components` folder contains more React components, these are consumed by the Page components. The `reducers`, `selectors` and `store` directories contain code responsible for state management. This app relies on [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. Finally, the `utils` directory contains useful helper functions.
